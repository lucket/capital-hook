## Capital Hook: TradingView to Capital.com Webhook Automation
Capital Hook is a powerful, self-hosted FastAPI application for algorithmic traders. It serves as a **bridge between TradingView alerts (signals, screeners, Pine Script strategies) and the Capital.com CFD/forex execution API**, enabling you to automate trade execution based on your strategies. Eliminate manual trading and harness automation to respond instantly to market opportunities!

## ✨ Features

Capital Hook provides a robust set of features designed to empower algorithmic traders with seamless automation and real-time insights:

- **Automated Trade Execution**: Automatically execute trades on your Capital.com account when triggered by alerts from TradingView. This includes signals from indicators, screener results, and complex Pine Script strategies.
- **Real-time Dashboard**:
  - **Portfolio Balance**: Monitor your Capital.com account's real-time balance directly within the application's dashboard.
  - **Live Positions**: View all trades currently in execution or managed by Capital Hook, providing immediate oversight of your active strategies.
  - **Demo & Live Mode Toggle**: Easily switch between your Capital.com demo and live accounts to test strategies risk-free or deploy them confidently to real markets.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: A dedicated configuration page allows you to tailor the webhook behavior and trade parameters without modifying code:
- **Payload Setup**: Define custom JSON payloads for incoming TradingView webhooks to perfectly match your strategy's needs.
    - **Stop Loss (SL) & Take Profit (TP)**: Set default or dynamic SL/TP levels for automated trade management.
    - **End of Day Close (`EOD_CLOSE`)**:  Automatically manages trades when the market is about to close for the day. If enabled, the hook will close any open position for the instrument 2 minutes before the market closes, ensuring positions are not left open during market downtime.
    - **End of Week Close (`EOW_CLOSE`)**: Automatically closes any open positions for the instrument 2 minutes before the end of the trading week, ensuring positions are not left open during weekend market downtime.- **Strategy (`STRATEGY`) Switch**: Ensures that for each unique combination of `epic` and `hook_name` (strategy identifier), only one trade direction is active at a time. If a new signal arrives with the opposite `direction` (e.g., switching from BUY to SELL), the existing position is closed before opening the new one.
    - **Hook Name (`HOOKNAME`) Switch**: Allows you to differentiate between multiple strategies or instances of the hook, providing more granular control and logging for each strategy or alert source.
- **Comprehensive Trade History**: Gain detailed insights into your performance with a real-time view of all closed trades, including:
    - **Detailed PnL (Profit & Loss)**: Analyze the profitability of individual trades and overall strategies.
    - **Execution Timestamps**: Track when trades were opened and closed.
    - **Associated Strategy Data**: Link closed trades back to the specific strategies that initiated them.
    - **Persistent Storage with SQLite**: All trade history is securely stored in a local SQLite database, ensuring your trade records are retained across restarts and easily accessible for analysis.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Epic Subscription Limit**: Currently, Capital Hook can subscribe to a maximum of **40 unique epics (trading instruments)** at any given time. While you can initiate and manage an unlimited number of trades, all concurrently active trades must fall within this limit of 40 subscribed epics. This means your diverse strategies should consider this constraint on the number of distinct instruments traded simultaneously.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: **FastAPI** (Python) - A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **HTTP Requests**: **`httpx`** - A powerful, user-friendly HTTP client for Python, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous requests, used for interacting with the Capital.com API.
- **Configuration Management**: **Environment variables** and potentially **`python-dotenv`** for loading configurations from a `.env` file, ensuring sensitive information is kept secure.
- **Web Server**: **`Uvicorn`** - An ASGI web server, recommended for running FastAPI applications due to its speed and asynchronous nature.

## 🚀 Installation & Environment Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up and running Capital Hook on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.9+**: The project relies on features available in newer Python versions. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **`pip`**: The standard Python package installer. This usually comes pre-installed with Python.
- **`git`**: A version control system used for cloning the project repository. If you don't have it, [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### 1\. Clone the Repository

First, open your terminal or command prompt and clone the Capital Hook repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danieltonad/capital-hook.git
cd capital-hook
```

### 2\. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's highly recommended to use a **virtual environment** for your project. This creates an isolated Python environment, preventing dependency conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows (use PowerShell or Git Bash for 'source' or just type the path)
```

You should see `(venv)` prepended to your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

---

### 3\. Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install all the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will download and install all necessary libraries for Capital Hook to run.

---

### 4\. Configure Capital.com API Credentials

Capital Hook needs your Capital.com API credentials to securely log in and execute trades on your behalf. For security best practices, these credentials should be stored as **environment variables** and never hardcoded directly into your application's source code.

Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of your project (the same directory where `main.py` is located). Add the following lines, replacing the placeholder values with your actual Capital.com API credentials:

```ini
CAPITAL_IDENTITY="YOUR_CAPITAL_COM_IDENTITY"
CAPITAL_PASSWORD="YOUR_CAPITAL_COM_PASSWORD"
CAPITAL_API_KEY="YOUR_CAPITAL_COM_API_KEY"
```

- Replace `"YOUR_CAPITAL_COM_IDENTITY"`, `"YOUR_CAPITAL_COM_PASSWORD"`

---

## ⚙️ Usage Guide

### Running the Application

To start the Capital Hook FastAPI application, ensure your virtual environment is activated and then run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

- `main:app`: This specifies that Uvicorn should run the FastAPI application instance named `app` found within `main.py`.
- `--host 0.0.0.0`: Makes the application accessible from all network interfaces on your machine. This is important if you plan to access the dashboard or send webhooks from another device or a deployed server.
- `--port 8000`: The port number on which the application will listen for incoming requests. You can change this if port 8000 is already in use.
- `--reload`: (Useful for development) This flag tells Uvicorn to automatically reload the application whenever it detects changes in your code, so you don't have to restart it manually.

Once the application is running, you should see output in your terminal indicating that Uvicorn is serving on the specified address and port.

### Accessing the Dashboard & Config Page

Once the Capital Hook application is running, you can access its web-based interfaces through your browser:

- **Dashboard**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/dashboard`
  - Here you can monitor your **real-time portfolio balance**, view **live positions**, and observe the status of your trades.
- **Config Page**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/config`
  - This page allows you to dynamically adjust various settings, including **webhook payload structures, Stop Loss/Take Profit defaults, and behavior switches** for market conditions or strategy identification.

### Configuring TradingView Webhooks

To automate your trades, you need to set up alerts in TradingView that send data to your Capital Hook instance via webhooks.

1.  **Determine your Capital Hook's Webhook URL**: This will be the public-facing URL of your deployed Capital Hook instance, followed by the webhook endpoint. Assuming your hook is running locally on port 8000, the default webhook URL would be `http://your-machine-ip:8000/webhook` (replace `your-machine-ip` with your computer's actual IP address if accessing from another device on your network, or your domain if deployed).

2.  **Create a TradingView Alert**:

    - Open TradingView and navigate to the chart or strategy from which you want to send alerts.
        - Click the "Alert" icon (the bell icon, typically on the right sidebar or from the top menu).
        - Configure your **Condition** (e.g., "Crossing," "Strategy Alert") and **Frequency** as needed for your strategy.
        - Under the "Notifications" tab, **check the "Webhook URL" box**.
        - In the "Webhook URL" field, enter the URL you determined in step 1 (e.g., `http://your-machine-ip:8000/webhook`).
        - In the **"Message"** field, construct a **JSON payload** that matches what Capital Hook expects. This payload should include the instrument, trade direction, amount, and any optional parameters like stop loss or take profit.

        **Example TradingView Alert Message (JSON Payload):**

        ```json
        {
        "epic": "{{ticker}}",
        "direction": "SELL",
        "amount": 100.0,
        "hook_name": "20/200EMA",
        "profit": 120.0,
        "loss": 50.0,
        "exit_criteria": ["TP", "SL", "STRATEGY", "MKT_CLOSED"]
        }
        ```

        **Payload Field Reference:**
        - **`epic`**: TradingView placeholder for the instrument symbol (e.g., `EURUSD`, `AAPL`).
        - **`direction`**: Trade direction, either `"BUY"` or `"SELL"`.
        - **`amount`**: Trade size, specified in the currency or units set for your Capital.com account (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP, etc.).       
        - **`hook_name`**: Custom identifier for the strategy or alert.
        - **`profit`**: Take Profit value.
        - **`loss`**: Stop Loss value.
        - **`exit_criteria`**: Array specifying exit conditions, such as `["TP", "SL"]`.

        > **Note:** The keys and structure above reflect the default expected payload for Capital Hook. If you have customized your webhook handler, refer to your `main.py` or webhook handler code for the exact payload requirements. Always ensure your TradingView alert message is valid JSON.
